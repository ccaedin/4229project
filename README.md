For this project I use SDL2 and glm

Keybindings:

# Time Taken
40 hours

# Remainder
I still have to implement shadow casting but I have been stuck on lighting for a while because of how hard it is to debug shader code.

The tutorial I referenced for the normal mapping included a way to turn the winding of vertices into tangents, so I adapted that code to fit different ways of constructing objects, from a simple case with a cube, to much harder with a cylinder and sphere.
