# 4229hw4

For this project I use SDL2 and SDL2 TTL and glm
The required files are arial.ttf, army.cpp, Text.cpp, Text.h

# Operation

You move the view with the left click and the mouse and change the scale with the scroll wheel.
Keybindings:
WASD - move
l/L - dim/brighen power
; - change sky color

# Time Taken
45 hours - complete rewrite in 3.3 and figuring out how to adapt glVertex to Array Objects

# Remainder
Torch Particles
Army

Cheap noise functions - exponential filter

l_t = rand() * alpha + l_last * (1-alpha)
