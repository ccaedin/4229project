# 4229hw4

For this project I use SDL2 and SDL2 TTL and glm
The required files are arial.ttf, army.cpp, Text.cpp, Text.h

# Operation

You move the view with the left click and the mouse and change the scale with the scroll wheel.
Keybindings:
WASD - move
l/L - dim/brighen power
; - change sky color

# Time Taken
45 hours - complete rewrite in 3.3 and figuring out how to adapt glVertex to Array Objects

# Remainder
Torch Particles
Army

Cheap noise functions - exponential filter

l_t = rand() * alpha + l_last * (1-alpha)

Okay so last spheres that are rendered are bigger than the other?

problem with sphere, probably not enough time for particle so I will use gjdsfklajl;kk;jldfsgdf;kljsdfa;jklasdfj;lksdfkjl;sacdfxasd;fjlkasdf;jklasfdjlk;./asfdgsfjkl;dasdfk;jlasasedrfjlt;k'fsdajl;k'asdf
